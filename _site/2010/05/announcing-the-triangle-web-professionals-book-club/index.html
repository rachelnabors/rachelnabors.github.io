        <p>I love reading books, specifically books relating to my craft, even tagentially. So I started a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=118085348208324">book club for web professionals in the Triangle/Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill/Carborro area</a>. Who is a web professional? Web pros are designers, developers, project managers and marketers. I wanted to cover a broad range of web workers because I've learned, through working for a larger company, that when developers only talk to developers and designers only talk to designers, communication breaks down and the quality of our creations suffers for it. The best teams talk to each other and learn from each other. So I want everyone to come together and share thoughts and books suggestions.</p>

<p>The books we read are light but insightful. Our firs book is Steve Krug's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321657292?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mangapunk-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321657292">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>, </em>a DIY guide to inhouse usability testing. Next month it will be Scott Belsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184312X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mangapunk-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159184312X"><em>Making Ideas Happen</em></a>, which is about getting ideas out of your head and into reality.</p>

<p>If you'd like to stop by, our first meeting is at Busy Bee Cafe on the 19th of May, 2010. More details on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=118085348208324&amp;v=app_2344061033">Facebook event's page</a>. Currently there are about 10 people RSVPed. I'm blown away by the positive response! I even had to call the establishment to set aside the loft area.</p>

<p>Seriously awesome stuff going on these days.</p>
