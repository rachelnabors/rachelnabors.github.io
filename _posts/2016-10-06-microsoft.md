title: "SIGGRAPH 2016 Deluxe Report Pt II: the 3D Web"
excerpt: "At this yearâ€™s SIGGRAPH, WebGL was everywhere, as was something called X3DOM. I met the Web3D Consortium and saw first-hand how 3D can be put to work inside browsers and educational systems to build a better world for us to live in."

I'm proud to announce that on November 7th I'll be joining the Microsoft Edge Team as a program manager. There I will represent the Web design and animation communities on the team and at conferences and continue my work with the W3C.

The decision was easy. Some of my favorite people are working on Edge, and the team's mature, level-headed approach to the building the Web forward gels with the earth bender in me. I've been watching friends and community members I respect like [Rachel White](https://twitter.com/ohhoe), [Stacey Mulcahy](https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes), and [Nolan Lawson](https://twitter.com/nolanlawson) head to Microsoft for the past year or so, and it says great things to me about the direction the company is heading. The areas where Microsoft has been investing recently, in deep learning and new kinds of interfaces from <abbr title="Natural User Interfaces">NUIs</abbr> to [MR](https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/solutions/virtual-reality/vr-ar-mr-sorry-im-confused/), are a sea change I want front row tickets for.

Working for myself has been a blast: I've met so many wonderful folks and made so many friends working with [different](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design/motion) [companies](https://www.smartsheet.com). I've learned a lot about the challenges different teams face, the importance of finding bleeding neck problems to solve, and how to train a classroom of fifty people up in eight hours. I've been able to [collaborate with Mozilla](http://devtoolschallenger.com/) (also some of my favorite people) and [contribute to the Web Animations API effort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API).

But building the Web forward as an independent was at odds with business development and accounting and all the other things one must do out on their own. Going in-house releases me from my least favorite kinds of work and lets me focus on what I'm good at and enjoy.

Of course, there'll be a lot of personal growth happening as well! This will be my first time working inside a large company as an employee, not a consultant. It's exciting to think about how I'm going to have to adapt to this new environment. But I'm not scared: I'll be surrounded by some of my favorite people, and I have great mentors.

Sadly, this position does mean I'll be leaving Portland. The past three years here have been the best of my life, and I'm not exaggerating. Portland is beautiful, wonderful. I've wanted to be here ever since I was a teenager. But I'm ready to try another Pacific Northwest city: Seattle.

I'd also like to give a shout out to features editor [Ivana McConnell](http://www.ivanamcconnell.com/) for manning [Web Animation Weekly](http://webanimationweekly) while I'm getting situated. Also thanks to our wonderful guest editors including [Val Head](http://valhead.com/), [Rachel Smith](https://rachsmith.com/), and [Petr Tichy](https://ihatetomatoes.net/).
