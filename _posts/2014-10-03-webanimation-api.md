_The updated post can be found [here](/waapi). This one is out of date!_

This post supplements my various [talks](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/state-of-the-animation-2014) about the the Web Animations API. Want to talk animation? [Shoot me an email!](mailto:rachelnabors@gmail.com)

* The [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/API/WebAnimations) (which I wrote)
* The [Web Animations API spec](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/)
* Its [polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) and a more experimental incarnation of the polyfill, [Web Animation Next](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next), which includes level 2 features like grouping and sequencing.

## How to give feedback
You can email <public-fx@w3.or> with subject beginning &ldquo;[web-animations] &hellip; &rdquo;

On IRC: irc.w3.org#webanimations

On the [Animation at Work Slack](http://slack.animationatwork.com)'s #WAAPI channel.

## Support
All browsers _except_ for webkit (iOS Safari, Safari) have begun implementing the API. It's a large API, so not all browsers have completely implemented all of its components. CanIUse.com is _not_ a reliable source for compatibility as it does not report in detail on which features are implemented in which browsers. Fortunately, [there's a manual test you can do yourself](http://codepen.io/danwilson/pen/xGBKVq).

<!-- ### Internet Explorer
You can [vote for IE to support the Web Animation API here](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-internet-explorer-platform/suggestions/6263650-web-animations-javascript-api). You can cast up to 3 votes at a time&mdash;make them count!
 -->

## FireFox
People who have some familiarity with C++ coding, [you can help implement the API in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction). [Brian Birtles](bbirtles@mozilla.com) might even mentor you! And Mozilla's always looking for people to help write docs on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org).

## People to follow/pester
* [Brian Birtles](https://twitter.com/brianskold)&mdash;major author of spec, Mozilla Japan
* [Tab Atkins](https://twitter.com/tabatkins)&mdash;Googler, coauthor, works on (CSS) specs
* [Me](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors)&mdash;Invited expert at W3C, vocal input-giver on spec.

And of course, you can meet us all on the #waapi channel at [the Animation at Work Slack](http://slack.animationatwork.com).
