This post supplements my talk about the state of animation in 2014 and the Web Animation API ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/state-of-the-animation-2014)).

* The [Web Animation API spec](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/)
* Its [polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) and the next incarnation of the polyfill, [Web Animation Next](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next)

If you don't have time to read through the spec, have a read through the [polyfill readme](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js#readme) to get an idea for the goodies in store.

## How to give feedback
You can email <public-fx@w3.or> with subject beginning &ldquo;[web-animations] &hellip; &rdquo;

On IRC:
irc.w3.org#webanimations

Unofficially, I will be keeping tabs on the [#waapi hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23waapi&src=typd). Not that I'm officially involved in the spec, but it's my hope that the spec authors and implementors will engage under that hashtag as well, thus allowing people who don't use IRC (like designers) and don't want to be a part of a long email chain to keep up to date with the discussion surrounding this API.

## How to make a difference
People who have some familiarity with C++ coding, [you can help implement the API in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction). [Brian Birtles](bbirtles@mozilla.com) might even mentor you! And Mozilla's always looking for people to help write docs on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org).

Minor fixes to the spec (grammar/spelling/inconsistencies etc.) can be submitted as pull requests to <https://github.com/w3c/web-animations>.
