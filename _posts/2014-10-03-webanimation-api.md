This post supplements my talk about the state of animation in 2014 and the Web Animation API ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/state-of-the-animation-2014)).

Additionally, I am available to train teams on how, why, when and where to use animation in your development life cycle. [Get on my training mailing list for 2015](http://eepurl.com/7AgAL) or [shoot me an email](mailto:rachelnabors@gmail.com).

That's me. Let's talk animation!

* The [Web Animation API spec](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/)
* Its [polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) and the next incarnation of the polyfill, [Web Animation Next](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next)
* [A video of Alex Danilo explaining how the Web Animation API works and why it is the biggest deal since Flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep0_0W0qWsc) in 4.5 minutes.

If you don't have time to read through the spec, have a read through the [polyfill readme](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js#readme) to get an idea for the goodies in store.

## How to give feedback
You can email <public-fx@w3.or> with subject beginning &ldquo;[web-animations] &hellip; &rdquo;

On IRC:
irc.w3.org#webanimations

Unofficially, I will be keeping tabs on the [#waapi hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23waapi&src=typd). Not that I'm officially involved in the spec, but it's my hope that the spec authors and implementors will engage under that hashtag as well, thus allowing people who don't use IRC (like designers) and don't want to be a part of a long email chain to keep up to date with the discussion surrounding this API.

## Getting it supported
Minor fixes to the spec (grammar/spelling/inconsistencies etc.) can be submitted as pull requests to <https://github.com/w3c/web-animations>.

### Internet Explorer
You can [vote for IE to support the Web Animation API here](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-internet-explorer-platform/suggestions/6263650-web-animations-javascript-api). You can cast up to 3 votes at a time&mdash;make them count!

## FireFox
People who have some familiarity with C++ coding, [you can help implement the API in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction). [Brian Birtles](bbirtles@mozilla.com) might even mentor you! And Mozilla's always looking for people to help write docs on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org).

## People to follow/pester
* [Brian Birtles](https://twitter.com/brianskold)&mdash;major author of spec, Mozilla Japan
* [Alex Danilo](https://twitter.com/alexanderdanilo)&mdash;Google Platform Team, coauthor
* [Tab Atkins](https://twitter.com/tabatkins)&mdash;Googler, coauthor, works on (CSS) specs
* [Me](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors)&mdash;I can't shut up about this stuff

## Bonus Round
* [GSAP](http://www.greensock.com/)&mdash;reigning heavyweight for complex, dynamic animations.
* [Velocity](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)&mdash;replacement for jQuery's laggy `.animate()`
* [CSS's `will-change` property](https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/)
