## What's this all about?

I've been very fortunate this year: <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/2016/10/06/microsoft/">completing my first year at Microsoft</a>, publishing my first technical book <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/animation-at-work">Animation at Work</a>, living my dream of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMEzMVk8yAU">giving a keynote in Munich</a> in a dirndl (yes, really, that happened!) alongside super amazing smart people. I feel very lucky.

But I couldn't have gotten here on my own. I like to say that three things changed my life:

* The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided computers and internet access to rural libraries (like mine).
* Amazon.com for shipping niche technical books and supplies to an area of the country that had no access to these things.
* And my local Bookmobile, for bringing me books and human contact from my youth through my adulthood.

And now's the time to focus on that last one: My old Bookmobile needs help. After years of service it needs replacing, and the library has started a <a href="http://www.patrickcountybookmobilefund.org/">fundraiser</a> for it. They need some help getting across that finish line, and I want to help.

That's why from now till the end of Cyber Monday, all of my online courses are 50% off and I will donate 100% of the profits to the Bookmobile fund. What's more, Microsoft has a generous matching program:

<strong>For every dollar you spend on my CSS Animations and cartooning courses, Microsoft will match my donation 100%.</strong>
