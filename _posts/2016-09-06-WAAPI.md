The best place to start learning about the Web Animations API is the [documentation I wrote for MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/API/WebAnimations) on a Mozilla Foundation grant. But it's a big spec, and sometimes it helps to get a fast overview with some talks and slides:

## Talks
* *State of the Animation* ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOq1bnlZXk) and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/state-of-the-animation-2014)) is all about where the Web Animations API came from and what it means for the Web.
* *Alice in Web Animations API Land* ([recording](https://vimeo.com/163510676) and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/alice-in-web-animations-api-land)) is an introduction to the API via cute Alice in Wonderland demos.
* *The Web in Motion* ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX_TWlDe-Is&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLBevk0eXLOGdZ4yHChA-JW69DCBe7uGkJ) and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/the-web-in-motion-animations-impact-on-ui-and-web-design)) gets into how animation specifically is a big deal for building the Web forward.

## Demos
* [The Alice in Web Animations API Land demo collection](http://codepen.io/collection/bpEza/) on CodePen
* Some more official [Web Animations API demos](https://web-animations.github.io/web-animations-demos/)

## Communities
[The Animation at Work Slack](http://slack.animationatwork.com) has an entire #WAAPI channel frequented by spec author [Brian Birtles](https://twitter.com/brianskold) and [Web Animations API](http://danielcwilson.com/) enthusiasts like Dan Wilson. A great place to engage in real time conversations about the spec&mdash;a major reason I founded the Slack! Shoo, go chat.

## How to give feedback
* On [the Web Animation API's github repository](https://github.com/w3c/web-animations/) (preferred by the W3C community)
* Email <public-fx@w3.or> with subject beginning &ldquo;[web-animations] &hellip; &rdquo;
* On IRC: irc.w3.org#webanimations
* On the [Animation at Work Slack](http://slack.animationatwork.com)'s #WAAPI channel.

## Support
It's a big API, so while Firefox 48 and Chrome have
The [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/API/WebAnimations) provides the most up-to-date, granular, and accurate feature support information.

There is a [polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) for unsupported features and browsers like Edge and Safari. Its more experimental incarnation, [Web Animation Next](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next), which includes level 2 features like grouping and sequencing.

Speaking of, [Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/webanimationsjavascriptapi/) and [Safari](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122912) developers have moved the Web Animations API into their respective to-do lists.

*Beware:* Our beloved CanIUse.com is _not_ a reliable source for compatibility as it does _not_ report in detail on which features are implemented in which browsers. [There is a manual test you can do yourself](http://codepen.io/danwilson/pen/xGBKVq) just to be sure.
