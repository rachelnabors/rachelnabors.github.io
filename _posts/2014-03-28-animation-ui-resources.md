## Software
A number of UIs have been created to help people create animations easier. I prefer to hand code everything and build my own tools, but others who do not have that luxury will be interested in these:

* [Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/)
* [Adobe Edge Animate](http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/)
* [Google's Web Designer](https://www.google.com/webdesigner/)
* [Sencha Animator](https://www.sencha.com/products/animator/)
* [Animatron](http://animatron.com/)

Pasquale D'Silva [has written about](https://medium.com/design-idea/f755c6515368) [the need for better animation tools](https://medium.com/elepath-exports/ad5c2e4149d0). I remain confident that when browser vendors like Mozilla create proper timeline tools, the need for an animation UI will become less pressing and the browser will potentially become a viable animation IDE.
