Lately I've been on a CSS3 Animations/HTML5 audio jag. It's <strong>just so much fun,</strong> I've been working hard to share my techniques with everyone:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://24ways.org/2012/flashless-animation/">24 Ways posted my article about Flashless Animation</a></li>
  <li>Check out my <a href="http://www.rachelnabors.com/animation/candyHalo1/slides/index_cssdevconf2012.html">slides from my CSS Dev Conf talk "Animated Music Videos with CSS Animations and HTML5 Audio"</a></li>
</ul>
Additionally, you can check out some of the live demos I've done directly:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.rachelnabors.com/animation/nyantuna/">NyanTuna</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rachelnabors.com/animation/candyHalo1/final/">Final "Candy Candy" animation</a></li>

</ul>
Hope you get inspired. Please, show me what you come up with!
