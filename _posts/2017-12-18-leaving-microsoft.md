As of yesterday I am no longer working for Microsoft. 

It's been an amazing journey behind the scenes, seeing how Microsoft's Edge browser is made. I had the honor and privilege to meet and work alongside people who built one of the very first browsers I ever opened, a browser that over a decade ago set the stage for the way we use and build the Web today. (Seriously, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMEzMVk8yAU">watch this talk I gave at JS Kongress</a> about how Internet Explorer 4 and 5 changed the Internet forever!)

## Shout outs
I'd like to give a shout out to some of the wonderful folks I've had pleasure of working with including (but not limited to):
* <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/">Nolan Lawson</a> who brought me in behind him to join the team—it's been an experience I wouldn't trade for anything.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickkettner?lang=en">Patrick Kettner</a> aka World's Best Conference Travel Buddy.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/gregwhitworth">Greg Whitworth</a> for always encouraging and teaching everyone around him.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/molant">Anton Molleda</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alrra">Cătălin Mariș</a>, whose linter <a href="https://sonarwhal.com/">sonarwhal</a> will help you build better sites.
* <a href="https://github.com/TheLarkInn">Sean Larkin</a>, core contributor to <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">WebPack</a>&mdash;and more importantly, the orchid dad to my orchid mom.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/TravisLeithead">Travis Leithead</a> who showed me the Way of the W3C.
* <a href="https://www.kirupa.com/">Kirupa Chinnathambi</a>, whose CSS animations and transitions writings I admired long before coming to Microsoft.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/bterlson">Brian Terlson</a>, program manager on Edge's JavaScript engine and an awesome person to share Bavarian brats with.
* <a href="https://twitter.com/NellWaliczek">Nell Waliczek</a> who has been an amazing mentor and my inspiration to get into WebVR.

All of these people are folks of the highest caliber, and I look forward to seeing what great things they do in the future.

(And if you're wondering why other awesome folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/juliehubs">Julie Hubschman</a> aren't on this list, it's only because I didn't get to work closely with them&mdash;they're on completely different teams and in other locations!)

## What's next?
I'm looking forward to taking some time off to reconnect with the technologies I love; master algorithms, Vue.js, and WebXR.  

I have no idea what comes next, but I'm interested to hear your ideas: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek7XSkSnpqOBC0RP7kYJ7AjDu0_HypZ2qAIsPKJWDox3akmw/viewform?usp=sf_link">drop me a note!</a>
