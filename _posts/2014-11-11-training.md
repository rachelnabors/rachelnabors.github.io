When I speak at conferences and give talks like [The State of the Animation](http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/state-of-the-animation-2014), invariably members of the audience come to me afterward and say, "I wish I could draw like you!" My response has always been, "Sure you can! Take a 75% pay cut and doodle for the next seven years!"

After enough of this, I started hosting drink and draws and sketching parties at conferences. I'd show people a few tricks from cartooning, and everyone got a lot out of it. So I thought, during those sluggish, boring winter months of 2015, I could teach people in earnest online, through a little "cartooning for technical people" course. I quietly opened registrations through a few tweets, and January filled right up!

I'm offering [an overflow class in February](/training) for those who want to come learn the "comic secrets" to visual communication! [Sign up while there are seats left!](/training)
