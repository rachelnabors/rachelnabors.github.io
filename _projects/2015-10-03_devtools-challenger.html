<p>Mozilla approached me about building an interactive site to celebrate the new visual design tools in Firefox Developer Edition 44. With only five weeks until launch, I had to come up with an arresting idea fast, so I drew from my childhood fascination with the deep sea to pitch a site full of dev tools challenges with fascinating deep sea creatures.</p>

<p><a href="http://motionographer.com/2016/04/19/web-animation-learning-by-doing-an-interview-with-rachel-nabors/" target="_blank">Production</a> had to move fast, so I requested muscle: Mozilla put two JavaScript developers on the project and a music designer. I brought in a logo designer, a local illustrator, and a copy editor to round out the team. And yes, I <a href="https://dribbble.com/rachelthegreat/projects/314746-Deep-See-Adventure" target="_blank">rolled up my sleeves</a> and coded a great deal of the front end as well. We made the deadline&mdash;<em>and</em> made something unforgettable.</p>

<p>For me, DevTools Challenger is proof that when we work together, we can make something greater than ourselves.</p>
