<p>Black Brick Road is a multimedia web comic by the Russian creator <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xamag" target="_blank">Xamag</a>. Heavily inspired by interactive storygames like <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/" target="_blank">Homestuck</a>, Black Brick Road was <a href="http://xamag.deviantart.com/art/BBR-4-Room-350874422" target="_blank">originally done in Flash</a>. I teamed up with Xamag to do an early installment, <a href="http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/full/lqswg" target="_blank">a map game</a>, using CSS animations and transitions at a time when interaction design and animation had largely withdrawn from the front end development.</p>

<p>Later on we teamed up again to create <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/blackbrickroad/" target="_blank">The Room Game</a>, a cottage clean up game using HTML5's Drag and Drop API. This was the project that got me to leave my Job Job, and I haven't looked back. Ever since, I've been on the look out for more chances to work with wonderful creators and illustratros and bring their work and mine together.</p>
