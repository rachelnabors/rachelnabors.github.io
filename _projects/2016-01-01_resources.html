<p>Back in 2015 I started curating and circulating <a href="http://webanimationweekly.com" target="_blank">Web Animation Weekly</a>. In a little over a year its readership grew to 3,000 subscribers, and I brought on a features editor to help shoulder the load. Some readers <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rachelnabors" target="_blank">donate money</a> to help cover the costs of publication, but otherwise it is labor of love.</p>

<p>The next year, 2016, in keeping with my theme of <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/2015/12/31/gatekeeping-vs-gardening/">gardening over gatekeeping</a>, with the help of a few volunteers from the Web Animation Weekly community, we set up the <a href="http://slack.animationatwork.com" target="_blank">Animation at Work Slack</a> and a form that lets people add themselves to the Slack.</p>

<p>Neither of these projects would be as far along as they are without the help of volunteers and the strong backing of the community. For that I am proud.</p>
