<h1>Web Animation &amp; Motion Design Consulting</h1>
<p class="tagline">It's dangerous to go alone. Take me with you.</p>

<p>Are you building a <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html">design framework</a>? Trying to bring that &ldquo;native feel&rdquo; to your web app? Or maybe you just want to update your team's skills. I can help&hellip;</p>

<ul>
  <li>&hellip;get your whole team on board and in-the-know with animation best practices.</li>
  <li>&hellip;author detailed animation style guides and interaction storyboards.</li>
  <li>&hellip;spot interactions within your <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> where transitions and animations can ease cognitive load.</li>
  <li>&hellip;contribute quality CSS and JavaScript to your codebase.</li>
  <li>&hellip;help your engineers incorporate animation callbacks and fallbacks into your site's frontend infrastructure.</li>
  <li>&hellip;evaluate existing animation for performance and effectiveness.</li>
  <li>&hellip;<a href="/training">train your team</a> to do all these things for themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've worked with some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley with all of the above. I've been doing browser-first animation <del>before it was cool</del> since day one, writing <a href="http://24ways.org/2014/five-ways-to-animate-responsibly/">articles</a> and giving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOq1bnlZXk">talks</a> both on <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/web-animation-at-work">theory</a> and <a href="http://24ways.org/2012/flashless-animation/">implementation</a>. My efforts have landed me in the W3C's CSS Working Group, where I <del>argue</del> advocate on behalf of developers and designers in the field.</p>
