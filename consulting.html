<h1>Web Animation &amp; Motion Design Consulting</h1>
<p class="tagline">It’s dangerous to go alone. Take me with you.</p>

<p>Animation is a healthy part of a balanced user experience, whether you’re developing apps for watches or government websites. Improving your user’s experience will attract and retain more users, as well as guiding them toward desired actions. In other words, expert motion design can help you decrease churn and increase revenue.</p>

<p>Good motion design can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ease cognitive load</li>
  <li>increase perceived speed</li>
  <li>add delight to an otherwise static environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Every team and every project faces different animation challenges, which is why I offer custom workshops, training sessions, and audits to suit every situation. I can help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design immersive, delightful experiences with motion and meaning</li>
  <li>Develop performant, maintainable animations that integrate with your design system</li>
  <li>Create accessible animations for older users and users with vestibular disorders</li>
  <li>Integrate animation into your design process with prototyping, storyboard, and animatics</li>
  <li>Identify interaction bottlenecks where animation expedites the user’s journey</li>
  <li>Communicate animation deliverables across a team or organization</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve given workshops at companies and conferences in eight different countries; write about web animations and UI animation for publications such as <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/web-animation-past-present-and-future">A List Apart</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/create-storyboards-your-animations-21619177">Net Mag</a></em>, and _Adobe Inspire_; keynote conferences including O’Reilly’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9CB7EiU9xg">OSCON</a>, and have helped motion into design systems including <a href="http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design/motion/">Lightning Design System</a>.</p>
