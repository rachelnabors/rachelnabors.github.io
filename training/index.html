      I teach from a place of creative coding and my rich history as an award-winning cartoonist. As a web designer turned front-end developer, I connect the silos of design, UX, and programming wherever I teach. This empathy for all parts of the human equation required for building a better web lets me engage all attendees, no matter their level or job title.
