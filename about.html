    <p>I began telling stories online as a teenager with my award-winning web comics series, <i><a href="http://rachelthegreat.com">Rachel the Great</a></i>. My love of web technologies transformed into a career in front end development (well, there's more to it, which you can <a href="#full-story">read about below</a>). Since then, I've worked with Mozilla, the W3C, and currently Microsoft to build the web forward.</p>

    <p>I cultivate the web animation community via the <a href="http://slack.animationatwork.com">Animation at Work Slack</a> and her <a href="http://webanimationweekly.com">web animation newsletter</a>. When I'm not traveling the world, giving talks and taking selfies with birds, you can find me perched in Seattle, sipping a cup of fancy tea.</p>

    <p>Available for <a href="/speaking">speaking</a>, <a href="/consulting">consulting</a>, and pen pal-ery with disadvantaged teen girls looking to get into tech (been there, done that).</p>

    <h2 id="full-story">Rachel's (Inspiring? Hard luck?) Story</h2>
    <p>Rachel was home-schooled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where she learned goose wrangling and Photoshop. After watching <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/">Chasing Amy</a></em> at the tender age of 14, she started <a href="http://rachelthegreat.com">making comics</a> which helped her escape rural poverty and lead to several industry awards: A Kim Yale for best new female talent and a Nerdlinger in 2007 which she still trots out at parties to resolve comics-based disputes amongst guests. She never did finish her community college associates degree in communication design. She was interrupted by the unfortunate necessity of earning money.</p>

    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@rachelnabors/dont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2">When life happened</a>, she shifted gears to web development, grudgingly leaving her fandom behind. This was a natural calling: Rachel had always built sites and tinkered with opensource CMSes to help manage her readership community and promote her comics. One of her first sites was a Drupal community, and her first blog was ran on Greymatter. Trying to find the niche where she belonged, she worked in web design, UX, and programming. She finally settled into front-end development for the long haul, because it was a role where clients would argue with her the least.</p>

    <p>The widespread adoption of CSS Animations and Transitions rekindled her creative spark in 2012 when she delivered her first talk on animation in for a Flash-less web. After that, she was hooked! With all pressing obligations for a steady income removed, she wandered off to Portland and a life of giving talks and traveling the world. (You can read a comic timeline of my career development over in the <a href="/archive">archive</a>.)</p>

    <p>And now she works at Microsoft on Edge, her first truly Adult Job, and one where she feels she can finally give back to the very thing that made her life so rich: the Internet. The end.</p>

    <p><code>&lt;/third-person&gt;</code></p>
